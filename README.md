[newserv](https://github.com/fuzziqersoftware/newserv) is a game server and proxy for Phantasy Star Online (PSO). Check there for the full README.

This version of the codebase contains some modifications and [a script](run_newserv.py) to enable events that change automatically, and PSO2-style emergency quests (elimination quests). The script also runs and HTTP server which can be used as a registration server. It's currently technically unstable, but should work fine for most small servers.
